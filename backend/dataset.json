This course will take you through key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll understand the state of the field, and you\u2019ll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to showcase what you\u2019ve learnt.",
