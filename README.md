# SkillsBuildSearch

Using Node LTS 18.14.2

## How to run SkillsBuildSearch

1. First, ensure Node and NPM are updated on your computer to the latest LTS versions.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. After this has completed, run `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server. When deploying to production, run `npm run build` - this will create a `dist` folder with the bundled and minified javascript.
5. Open the URL it presents in your browser. The DOM will update automatically with any changes you make to the code, so there's no need to refresh manually.

You can read more in the README.md file in the frontend folder.

## Backend development version
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder using the terminal.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the prebuild script with `npm run prebuild`.
4. Start the web server with `npm run start`.
