Using Node LTS 18.12.1.

Going to include Bootstrap CDN

## How to run development version

1. First, ensure NPM and Node are updated on your computer to the latest LTS versions.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. After this has completed, run `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server.
5. Open the URL it presents in your browser. The DOM will update automatically with any changes you make to the code, so there's no need to refresh manually.

You can read more in the README.md file in the frontend folder.
